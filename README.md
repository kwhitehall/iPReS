#Introduction
The Internationalization (i18n) Product Retrieval Service is a web service and client providing 
i18n-type access to products and product metadata contained within [NASA JPL's](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) 
[Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center](http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/) otherwise known as 
PO.DAAC.

The software implements a [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) 
[Apache CXF](http://cxf.apache.org) web-service and client to obtain data from the [PO.DAAC 
Web-Services API](http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/ws/index.html). It then translates the product metadata into 
a target language provided along with the intial call to the service.
